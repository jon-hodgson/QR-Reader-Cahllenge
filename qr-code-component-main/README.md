### What I learned

I learned alot in this section it was quite difficult for me as i am new and this is the first project ive done without copying any code. I learned that i do not have to know everything i learned and that there are good resources out there like W3school. A couple of things i struggled with were containing the image within the container i feel like there is a better way to keep it withing the limits of my container however i ended up just adjusting the width manually and i couldnt really mess with the padding that way, everytime i adjusted the padding past 15px it seemed to push to the right of the container whcih was really frustrating. I believe i got it as good as i can get it however there is so much i can improve on.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<div class="container">
  <!-- this may seem super easy to some but for me it was nice that i remembered to use a container class it was easier to get things centered on the page as long as i put the QR reader in a container. -->
</div>
```

```css
html,
body {
  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  line-height: 1.6rem;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100%;
  text-align: center;
  font-family: "outfit", sans-serif;
}

/* I was proud of this however im sure that there is a better way of writing this. at first i was doing everything without adding the display:flex; */
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me alot because i knew what i was trying to do but for some reason i could not make it work so this site really helped me get a grasp of how i should write the code without it being purely copy and paste.
- [Example resource 2](https://discord.gg/TExgh5xF) - This is a group of programmers that i found in the city i live in. there was a moment i was having trouble keeping the image within the container and they had helped me out tremmendously without writing the code themselves. very helpful comminity and im glad i found them.
